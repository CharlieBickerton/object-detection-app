## Developer Requirements
To get this app running you will need some familiarity with React, Flask & docker (for the mongo db).

## Notes
I am using the python package dotenv https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv to supply secrets to the flask server using a .env file.

Please note that this is just a personal project and it is not meant to be a robust production ready web application. I will not be maintaining support for this repo. However, please feel free to get in contact if you have any questions.
